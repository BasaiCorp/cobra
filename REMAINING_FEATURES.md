# Cobra Package Manager - Remaining Features

## Overview
This document outlines the remaining features to be implemented in Cobra Package Manager to achieve feature parity with modern package managers like pip, uv, pnpm, and cargo.

## Current Status
Cobra currently implements core package management functionality including installation, dependency resolution, caching, and global Python integration via .pth files.

## Critical Missing Features (Priority 1)

### Package Information & Management
1. **cobra list** - List all installed packages with versions
2. **cobra show <package>** - Display detailed package information
3. **cobra search <query>** - Search PyPI registry for packages

### Package Lifecycle
4. **cobra uninstall <package>** - Remove packages from system (not just config)
5. **cobra freeze** - Generate requirements.txt from installed packages
6. **cobra check** - Validate dependencies and detect conflicts

### Maintenance & Cleanup
7. **cobra clean** - Clean cache, temporary files, and orphaned packages
8. **cobra doctor** - Diagnose installation and configuration issues
9. **cobra outdated** - Show packages with available updates

## Standard Features (Priority 2)

### Environment Management
10. **Virtual Environment Support** - Create isolated Python environments
11. **Environment Switching** - Switch between different environments
12. **Environment Listing** - List all available environments

### Dependency Management
13. **Lock File Generation** - Create cobra.lock for reproducible builds
14. **Dependency Tree** - Visualize package dependency relationships
15. **Version Constraint Parsing** - Proper semantic versioning support

### Development Workflow
16. **Development Dependencies** - Enhanced dev-dependencies handling
17. **Editable Installs** - Install packages in development mode
18. **Build System Integration** - Support for pyproject.toml

## Advanced Features (Priority 3)

### Performance & Storage
19. **Content-Addressable Storage** - Deduplicated package storage like pnpm
20. **Hard Link Optimization** - Share packages across projects
21. **Workspace Support** - Monorepo and multi-project management

### Advanced Dependency Resolution
22. **Peer Dependencies** - Advanced dependency resolution patterns
23. **Feature Flags** - Optional package features and extras
24. **Platform-Specific Dependencies** - OS and architecture-specific packages

### Build & Deployment
25. **Build Scripts** - Pre/post install hooks and custom build steps
26. **Patch Dependencies** - Override and patch package versions
27. **Bundle Generation** - Create distributable package bundles

## Unique Cobra Features (Priority 4)

### Intelligence & Analytics
28. **Smart Package Recommendations** - AI-powered package suggestions
29. **Security Scanning** - Vulnerability detection and reporting
30. **Performance Analytics** - Installation and usage metrics

### Cross-Platform & Integration
31. **Cross-Language Support** - Node.js, Rust package integration
32. **Cloud Configuration Sync** - Sync settings across machines
33. **IDE Integration** - VS Code, PyCharm plugin support

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Completeness (Features 1-9)
Complete essential package manager functionality to achieve pip/uv parity.

### Phase 2: Standard Enhancement (Features 10-18)
Add standard package manager features for professional development workflows.

### Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities (Features 19-27)
Implement pnpm/cargo-inspired advanced features for enterprise use.

### Phase 4: Innovation (Features 28-33)
Add unique Cobra features that differentiate from existing package managers.

## Success Criteria

Each feature implementation must include:
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Documentation updates
- Performance benchmarks
- Backward compatibility verification
- Error handling and user feedback

## Testing Requirements

- All features must pass automated test suites
- Real-world usage scenarios must be validated
- Performance regression tests must pass
- Cross-platform compatibility must be verified

## Quality Standards

- Code must follow Rust best practices
- Error messages must be clear and actionable
- Performance must meet or exceed existing tools
- User experience must be intuitive and consistent
